## **Shader Project**

This document aims to detail the proposed goals, technical challenges, development plan and execution of the a shader project of the Computer Graphics in Games course, which took place in Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon.


## **Installation**

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/zorrocrisis/ShaderProject`**
2. Open the ShaderProject.snl solution using Visual Studio
4. Build the project
5. Start the project (executable should be in Build > Release/Debug)

## **Materials and Objects**

Two different materials were planned to be developed throughout the course of this project: cork and metal. The choice of these contrasting materials gives way to multiple technical challenges, which are also pointed
out later in this document.

Firstly, what better way to represent Portugal than to develop such a widely known and proudly portuguese material like cork? The goal is to make a stylised/semi-realistic solid material with procedural noise to convey
the natural look of cork, which happens to be very uneven and rough. Regarding its application, the cork material will be used to make a cork stopper (sometimes simply called “cork”, as well). The following images demonstrate the overall desired look of the material’s surface and its usage in a 3D model of a cork stopper.
